# devsecops-pipeline-workshop

Instructions and code for Gene Gotimer's Building a DevSecOps Pipeline workshop.

## Lesson 1: Assess the risks

Visit our JPetStore target application at http://jpetstore.demo.secureci.com/.

Click around, visit some links, try to accomplish something to get a feel for the app. Notice what looks polished, what doesn't, where sensitive data is collected and retrieved. *Get a feel for what might worry you once the application is pushed into production.*

* Brainstorm
* Discuss the threats and risks
* Discuss what might make you feel more at ease about the risks

This is simple, back-of-the-napkin-type threat modeling and risk assessment. For a more methodical, detailed approach consider using the [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling) in conjunction with [Microsoft STRIDE](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2007/09/11/stride-chart/), or other [threat modeling methodologies](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2018/12/threat-modeling-12-available-methods.html)
